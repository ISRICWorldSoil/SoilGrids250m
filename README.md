# SoilGrids250m
Global spatial predictions of soil properties and classes at 250 m resolution.

This repository hosts the source code used to create the SoilGrids version published in 2017 (Hengl et al. 2017). The maps generated in 2017 can be downloaded from [here](https://files.isric.org/soilgrids/former/2017-03-10/data/). For information about the most recent version of SoilGrids, please visit the [project page](https://www.isric.org/explore/soilgrids). The new maps are displayed in the new portal [soilgrids.org](https://www.soilgrids.org).
